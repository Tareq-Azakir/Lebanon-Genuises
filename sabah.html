    <p>Al-Sabbah has over 40 patents in his name. Not only did he discover the processes of nuclear fission, but he was also the first to invent a television powered by sunlight. 

        It is even speculated that Al-Sabbah and Tesla, not Edison, were the fathers of modern electricity.

        The ingenuity of Al-Sabbah was so remarkable at such a young age that he was dubbed as “the youngest genius of the Electrical Association.”

        After having worked with Al-Sabbah, the principal inventor and designer of the GPS, Roger Lee Easton, had this to say about him: “Sabbah was the only one who dared discuss, criticize, and clarify Einstein theory on general relativity… .”
