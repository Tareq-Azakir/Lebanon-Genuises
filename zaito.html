    <p>11-year-old Sinar Zaito is a certified genius. Interestingly enough, his genius mind would have gone unnoticed if it wasn’t for his obsession with Rubik cubes.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>After teaching himself animation, Zaito began making short YouTube videos explaining scientific concepts such as the Fermi paradox, black holes, and how cells fight viruses.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>At first, his interest in science seemed natural. After all, his father is a high-school physics teacher, and his mother is a mechanical engineer. But it was his fascination with the classic puzzle that led to a sudden blossoming of his math skills.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>He delved into algorithms and advanced mathematical concepts on the internet, and within months, Zaito was doing math at a 12th-grade level.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>However, that wasn’t enough to keep him occupied. Searching for a way for her son to continue his progress, his mother emailed the math department at AUB…</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Today, Sinar is already learning analysis concepts generally taught to university students of advanced second-year mathematics.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>His professors believe that by the time Zaito is 14 or 15, he will be ready to pursue a doctorate in the United States if he chooses to. Who knows what’s in store for this miraculous young Lebanese boy? We can expect the unexpected!</p>
